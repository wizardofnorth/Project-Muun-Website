# Spiffy-iHub
A spiffy website for Inquiry Hub's student projects

This is particularly a tie-in for the school's Vancouver Mini Maker Faire booth.

## Yet To Be Done & Minor Changes

* possibly remove the 'splash screen' on entry. Regardless, something like it should point people towards an interactive map of the booth during the event. (Done)
* Obviously some sort of CMS must be implemented.
